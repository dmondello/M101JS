MongoDB is a powerful, flexible, and scalable data store. It combines the ability to
scale out with many of the most useful features of relational databases, such as secon-
dary indexes, range queries, and sorting. MongoDB is also incredibly featureful: it has
tons of useful features such as built-in support for MapReduce-style aggregation and
geospatial indexes.
